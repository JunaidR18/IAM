# IAM
A dedicated repository to showcase and develop my expertise in IAM

Welcome to my IAM Knowledge Showcase repository! Here, I am actively building and showcasing my expertise in Identity and Access Management (IAM).

With a strong intention to deepen my understanding of IAM concepts, frameworks, and technologies, this repository serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my practical knowledge and share my progress with the community.

I aim to showcase my hands-on experience in implementing IAM solutions. By exploring various IAM frameworks and standards like OAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, and LDAP, I am developing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Additionally, I intend to actively study directory services, such as LDAP and Active Directory, and gain insights into identity lifecycle management, access control models, and identity governance and administration. I am excited to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios and contribute to the ever-evolving IAM landscape.
